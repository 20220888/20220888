### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

Timeboxing is allotting a fixed, maximum unit of time for an activity. That unit of time is called a time box. The goal of timeboxing is to define and limit the amount of time dedicated to an activity. Scrum uses timeboxing for all of the Scrum events and as a tool for concretely defining open-ended or ambiguous tasks. I may have inadvertently use time boxing when I am working, I use to time myself for a days work by timing each place I go and spend so that I can return to office by a certain time.

I am proud I am able to tell the computer to do what I ask of it,however I am very dissappointed in my ownself with my slow learning of coding language.

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

I do not have strategy for learning. There are things that I can understand immediately and things that I am not able to get around my brain to understand it.
Anyways I will be slowly get the hang of it.


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say? 

Do it even if you know it is very hard to comprehend even if I do not know anything abut software. You will know eventually, maybe not withing this 6 month but give you a life long knowledge.

### What is Python?

A programming language, whereby programmer write their software.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

Not at the moment. too much thing to do with kids and work and family.

### Have you meditated before? 

not really

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

I do have a certain aspect of myself that do quite well in practical stuff.

Sad to say I did not participate in it was at home sick

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?

brains do not co-operate in coding. 

### What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.What is OOP example?
As an example, let's look at a Vehicle object. We can use this object to create other objects like a Car, a Truck or a Motorcycle. If the Vehicle has a Start method, it may be implemented by each child object differently. Polymorphism enables each person to implement the Start method differently. 

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?

I use it but not often. Very useful not tedious although can be better. be that as it may all program can be made better.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?

### What is pair programming?

2 person doing the same program in 1 computer. 2 brains is better than one. 

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?

to tell the computer what to do, also be able to understand why some program behaves the way it does.

### What is conscious listening?

### What is a variable?

variable is things are not fixed

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why? 

up till now only python it is to me the simplest to learn for me. I cannot process other language.

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?



### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?

### What is a fixed mindset?

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?
