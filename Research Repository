Up till now I have not been able to to code.
My understanding of coding is still not letting to code anything really except the activity given.
I am trying my best to try to understand the principle and how to get the phton to do what I want it to do but still not able to

I am actually have very poor understanding of software.
Now that I am exposed to software deveplopment, for the first time in my life I begin to realise the vast amount of work and time
goes into a particular program for it to make it into realisation.
It is like making Fine wine, No one knows whether the wine that is in the barrel is good quality or not albeit, every precaution is being done to ensure it to produce afine wine.
For the wine, the end result is when we drink it. This is simlar to software development no one can guranteee the program will run smoothly when use the fisrt time.

I may have some codes put in here when I am able to get my head around how to code into my thick skull.
In the meantime, the most interesting things about coding is the way computer behaves. 
I am beggining to understand that with all the hardware that is available for use in the IT world everything in the end fall back to how good the software developer or creator. It must be simple enough for the ordinary people to understand and make use of it. Which leaves the sofisticated part to the experts.
meaning the people on the street would only be able to get maybe 50 percent of the software but to the expert they can exploit to the max
